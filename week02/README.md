1. For each challenge, go into the directory of the challenge and run `docker-compose up -d`

	* Easy 2 and Medium 1: localhost:10002
	* Medium 2: localhost:10003
	* Hard:
		- API Server @ localhost:4000
		- AUTH Server @ localhost:3000

All flags will be in the format of `RS{flag_goes_here}`\
**Easy1:** Flag is at localhost:10001/getFlag\
**Easy2:** I can read! But what do I read? How is this **CONFIGURED?** \
**Medium 1:** Hint is located with the Easy2 flag :) \
**Medium 2:** Hope you did your taxes! (flag is in flag.txt) \
**Hard:** Check out our cool api server!
