#### Hints:
All flags will be in the format of `RS{flag_goes_here}`\
**Easy1:** A cronjob is trying to write the real flag to easy1, why is it still this bad fake flag :(? \
**Easy2:** I hid some popcorn, can you find it? EDIT: lscpu shows cpu info, lsof shows open files, lsusb shows usb info, etc. \
**Medium 1a:** What's my password? (password for the binary in /home/ritsec/) \
**Medium 1b:** Solve medium1a with a bash script! \
**Medium 2:** Medium2 is hiding the flag in their home directory! Go read it! \ 
**Hard:** Login to hard and read hard.txt in their home directory!

### Solution: (hard will be released on end of day Sunday!)
